# all about machine-learning
## Overview
A collection of things I did while I was learning about python & machine learning

## Usage
Open jupyter notebook & run `.ipynb` file, and make sure the data is already to use. Check the dataset I use in this project in the folder `assets-miniproject`. I'm if some of the data isn't available because of missing or human error.
